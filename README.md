Manipulating Real Estate Data Using dplyr

The underlisted five major functions are performed using the dplyr package which is a grammar of data manipulation
mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
select() picks variables based on their names.
filter() picks cases based on their values.
summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
